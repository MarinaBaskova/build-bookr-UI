	<h2>The Best Possible Price</h2>
	<img src="img/holdingbook.jpg">
	<p>Textbooks can be expensive. Our pricing algorithms make sure you get the best possible price for the textbook you're considering purchasing. If that wasn't enough, you can also lend and borrow textbooks with other members. This is nice because many textbooks are out of print and or extremely rare.</p>
